      <p class="APES_unit_title">Earth's Interior Layers</p>
      <p class="page_text">Our Earth is made up of 3 main layers of rock. </p>
      <p class="page_texts"><b>Core:</b> The inner most layer is the core, consisting of an <b>inner core</b> and <b>outer core</b>. The inner core is composed of mainly nickel and iron and also solid due to the immense pressures. The outer core is made of nickel, iron, and other elements. It's only semi-solids due to lower pressures and can be desribed as molten.<p/>
      <p class="page_texts"><b>Mantle: </b>The next layer consists of the mantle and is mainly solid rock. The upper part of the mantle is called the <b>asthenosphere</b>, which is mainly flowing, molten rock. The harder rock floating on top of the asthenosphere is called the <b>lithosphere</b>.</p>
      <p class="page_texts"><b>Crust:</b> The last layer is consisted of a thin layer of brittle and low density rock called the <b>crust</b>. This crust is part of the upper lithosphere and makes up the surface of our Earth.</p>

      <p class="APES_unit_title">Tectonic Plates</p>
      <p class="page_text">The Earth's crust is composed of 15 pieces of lithosphere called <b>tectonic plates</b> floating on the mantle. During the Paleozoic and Mesozoic ears, our contients were clumped together to form the supercontient, <b>Pangaea</b>. Where the plates meet are called <b>plate boundaries</b>, and depending on how they split different effects can occur.</p>
      <p class="page_texts"><b>Convergent Boundaries: </b>These plates are coming together. <b>Subduction</b> can occur with oceanic plates and one of these plates slides under the other, forming a trench. The plate underneath will then melt into magma and cause nearby volcanos to overflow and erupt. Volcanos may also form. However, if neither plates chooses to subduct, <b>continental collision</b> occurs, where the two plates go up and form mountain ranges.
      <p class="page_text"><b>Transform Boundaries: </b> The two plates slide past each other, causing earthquakes and <b>faults</b> to occur. These faults are just fractures in the rock.
      <p class="page_text"><b>Divergent Boundaries: </b> The two plates split apart, forming a <b>ridge</b> which can expose magma. When the magma cools, new lithosphere is created.</p><br><br>

      <p class="APES_unit_title">Rock Cycle</p>
      <p class="page_text">Rocks are created and recycled as 3 basic rock types.</p>
      <p class="page_texts"><b>Igneous rocks:</b> These rocks form from magma and other melted rocks. Intrusive igneous rock form when the magma cools slowly underground where minerals of different types can get together and form multi mineral rocks with vibrant colors.
      Extrusive igneous rock has little time to form crystals of minerals as it cools fast. This could happen due to ejection from a volcano. 
      <p class="page_texts"><b>Sedimentary rocks: </b> These rocks are formed when the pressure of sediments build up and press together through <b>compaction</b>. Minerals can then seep through and act as glue, a process called <b>cementation</b>. This process altogether, of transforming sediments into rock, is called <b>lithification</b>. Since sediments tend to pile up on each other and not mix, <b>stratas</b> ,or different layers in sedimentary rocks, can be observed to figure out the characteristics of certain time periods.</p>
      <p class="page_texts"><b>Metamorphic rocks: </b> These rocks are formed when a certain amount of heat or pressure is applied to the rock changing the appearance and physical properties. This usually occurs underground, where the temperature is hot enough to change the rock but not melt it.</p>

      <p class="APES_unit_title">Natural Disasters caused by Tectonic Plates</p>
      <p class="page_text"><b>Volcanos:</b> Pressure can cause magma to flow and seep out from the surface, forming volcanos. <b>Hot spots</b> are areas on tectonic plates where the magma has melted through and weakened the crust. This allows volcanos to form and even created the Hawaiian islands. The <b>Ring of Fire</b> is a ring that resides in the Pacific coasts of many contenients. The combination of plate boundaries and subduction zones, makes the ring highly active and accounts for around 90% of volcanos and earthquakes worldwide.</p>
      <p class="page_texts"><b>Earthquakes:</b> sudden plate movements can create violent vibrations called earthquakes. Often occuring from transform boundaries, earthquakes are most dangerous in areas of loose or water saturated soil, due to the high chance of the ground collasping. <b>Microquakes</b> are much smaller in magnitude and can be human caused, such as from underground nuclear testing or drilling for steam and heated water. </p>
      <p class="page_texts"><b>Tsunamis: </b>The virbrations from earthquakes or volcanic erruptions can cause huge waves of water to rise up and potentially cause massive damage.</p>
      <p class="page_texts"><b>Mass Wasting: </b> Large virbrations can also cause rocks and other debris to slide down sloped surfaces, causing landslides. Mudslides and lahars (caused from melted snow from volcanos) can slide down mountains and hills, causing mass flooding and destruction.</p>
  
        <p class="APES_unit_title">Earth's Mineral Resources</p>
        <p class="page_text"><b>Rocks</b> are clusters of minerals. A <b>mineral</b> is a solid chemical compound with unique properties and crystal structure. When mining for minerals, miners will often have to scout ahead for deposits, due to the nature of most minerals being spread across large areas in low densities. Most minerals are found inside of <b>ores</b> (a group of minerals and rock) and rarely found are pure. <b>Metals</b> are a chemical element that is lustrous, malleable and can conduct heat + electricity. This makes metals extremely useful for tech commponents, however, minerals need to be first treated physically and chemically to be useful. <b>Alloys</b> are created from metals being mixed with other metals or non-metals, an example being steel which is made of carbon and iron. <b>Smelting</b> is a process to create alloys, and involves melting metals to mix them together. <r>Processing metals have a whole slew of negative effects. Many methods are energy and water entensive, as well as emitting air pollution.</r> People extract many <b>non-metalic</b> metals as well. Sand and gravel is extracted for construction use, such as cement creation. Phosphates are mined for farming use. Fossil fuels and uranium are extracted to create electricity. Gemstones are mined for jewerly and economic reasons. <r>Conflict Materials, such as blood diamonds, often cause lots of violence and poor working conditions of the local population when extracted. Developing nations will often be exploited to extract these materials.</r></p>
    
        <p class="APES_unit_title">Mining</p>
        <p class="page_text">Mining is a multi-billion dollar industry, fueling millions of jobs worldwide. Despite all of this, many of the various mining styles causes lots of environmental damage. One of the main issues come from <b>tailings</b>, which are the extracted minerals and ore that is in the way of the main material you are mining for. These tailings piles will be tossed aside, exposing them to the elements. Sulfer can often be found in these tailings piles and when exposed to water and sunlight, will form sulferic acid. This <b>acid drainage</b> can leach metals out of the rocks and get into local ecosystems. This toxic <b>leachate</b> can poison groundwater and harm local organisms. Another environmental issue is removing <b>overburden</b>. Overburden is the top soil above the minerals that must be extracted in order to start mining. The soil is later put back, but local ecosystems and plants on it will be destroyed and the new looser soil is much more susceptible to erosion.</p>
        <p class="page_texts"><b>Strip Mining </b>is most effective in extracting mineral in horizontal layers, due to the method involving removal of the surface layer of overburden. Overburden and acid leachate are issues involving this method.</p>
        <p class="page_text"><b>Sub Surface Mining </b>involves digging long tunnels into the earth, and is most useful in extracting minerals that are found in large pockets spread throughout. Toxic leacate is again an issue. The tunnels themselves pose as dangers due accumulation of toxic fumes (ventalation is very important) and accidental explosions that can cause cave ins. The tunnels can still collaspe after the mine closes, creating massive sinkholes.</p>
        <p class="page_text"><b>Open Pit Mining</b> bascially ivolves digging a giant hole in the ground <b>(quarries)</b> for extraction. Acid drainage is a constant issue and if the quarry fills with water, the leacate can poison the new lake.</p>
        <p class="page_text"><b>Placer Mining</b> involves miners going to riverbeds and sifting through the water for minerals. Sifting through the riverbeds can release toxic debris and cause erosion.</p>
        <p class="page_text"><b>Mountain Top Removal</b> involves removing large chuncks of mountains to extract minerals. The soil and local vegetation is often removed and added to the overburden. This overburden is then tossed into the local valley below in the process called <b>valley filling</b>. Valley filling leads to damaged habitats, polluted waterways, and acid drainage. Deforested mountain top slopes create soil erosion, leading to mudslides and flashfloods. Dynamite is often used to clear the mountains, causing air pollution from dust and potential damage from debris. The local population will often get harrassed by the noise and trembles caused by explosions and vehicle transportation.</p>
        <p class="page_text"><b>Solution mining/ in-situ recovery</b> involves drilling a thin hole underground towards the mineral. A pipe is placed down the hole and injects acid to liquifiy the mineral and then sucked up. This method is actually very eco-friendly due to the very little land it uses, and only accidental leakage of the acid poses any harm.</p>
        <p class="page_text"><b>Ocean Mining</b> involves the extraction of many minerals underwater. Sand and gravel can be extracted for concrete and loose minerals in the water can be retrieved. Volcanic vents spew up dissolved minerals for extracting as well. Due to being done underwater, the process is still fairly ineffective, but over time as we use up the minerals above water we may need to resort to the ocean. Environmental damage from this method involves destroying underwater ecosystems and potentailly infusing the waters with toxins and minerals.</p>
    
        <p class="APES_unit_title">Mine Restoration</p>
        <p class="page_text">Many nations require the <b>reclamation</b> of mines after closing, meaning that the mining company has to restore the mine back to its original state. The US in 1993 passed the <b>Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act</b>, requiring companies to pay the US bonds before mining. Before this, mining companines would that went bankrupt while mining had no money to start reclamation but now the US can come in to start reclamation of the companies ever fail to start reclamation. Reclamation requires filling in the mined areas with soil and local vegetation should be reintroduced to hold the soils. Original topography of the land must be considered. Careful monitoring of the reclamation site is required for years to come in order to ensure the land is restored. These efforts are not easy and frequently acid drainage continues and ecosystem restoration is extremely difficult to accomplish. There have been talks of using speacil bacteria to clean acidic water caused by acid drainage. Originally, miners would use basic items, such as limestone, to counter the acidic water. However, these bacteria can convert the sulfates in the water in sulfides which can later be extracted. </p>
    
      <p class="APES_unit_title">Sustainability</p>
      <p class="page_text">Many people fear that are the current rate we are extracting minerals, it will not be sustainable nor eco-friendly. Til this day, the <b>General Mining Act of 1872</b> has allowed companies to basically pay nothing to stake out large chuncks of land for mining. Originally used to promote westward settlement, people have claimed this law has no reason to still exist and promotes rapid exploitation of the land for mining. Minerals do not form fast enough to be considered renewable and there is only a finite amount of time before we run out of minerals. </p>
      <p class="APES_unit_title">Many factors play into how long we can mine for minerals</p>
      <p class="page_text"><b>New Reserves</b> and more <b>efficient/advanced extration methods</b> can help increase the total amount of minerals we can extract.</p>
      <p class="page_text"><b>Changing consumption styles</b> will dictate which minerals are mined and can either increase or decrease the rate we mine up the minerals. For example, when copper wires are replaced with fiber optics the demand, and thus price, of copper will go down along with attempts of mining it.</p>
      <p class="page_text"><b>Recycling</b> is one of our best bets at sustainble minerals. Most metals get thrown away when they could be remelted and reused. Recycling metals is also much more eco-friendly and energy efficient than trying to mine for more. <b>E-waste</b> is especially important to recycle. Thie electronic waste, consists of computers, radios, phones, and other devices. The components of our devices contain many hard to obtain minerals and would be a waste to just throw away. The metals in our e-waste can also potentially create acid leakage in the landfills, poisoning local groundwater. Proper recycling of these devices can help save precious metals as well as preventing acid leakage.</p>
